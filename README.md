Santa Claus Site
A website where parents can create a list of presents, how many presents can be chosen from the list, when the presents will arrive
and the children can choose from the list (with drag and drop into the present) and send it to Santa. 
A timer will be shown after the list was sent, with how much time is left until the presents get to the children.
